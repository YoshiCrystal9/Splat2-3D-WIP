# Splat3D
A small Splatoon editor, based off of Kinnay's 3DW editor.

To use this editor, you need PyQt5, and PyOpenGL. These need to be ran on an installation of Python 3.4.

As of 1/12/16, Splat3D now uses new dependencies.

# How to use
First, download this program. 

Second, make sure you have PyQt5 and PyOpenGL installed.

If you installed pip with Python 3.4, run installGL.bat and it will install OpenGL for you.

If you do not, use this link for the installer.

PyOpenGL Download: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOpenGL/3.1.0

PyQt5 Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt5/PyQt-5.5.1/PyQt5-5.5.1-gpl-Py3.4-Qt5.5.1-x32.exe/download

https://github.com/zeldamods/byml-v2

Use 1 of the 2 links at the bottom to install. 

32-bit Python is *mostly* required, due to the PyOpenGL depency. 

Have fun!
